# Information

Create a composite and then import and directly use it in your optimized story as other SAP Analytics Cloud built-in widgets.

* A composite is a combination of widgets with configured data and scripting elements, which can be reused across optimized stories.
* It can be a unified corporate header or footer, page navigation panel, collapsible section with visualizations, or chart with a button to switch to another chart type or table view.
* With composites ready to be used in stories, story designers and developers spend less time building stories, and they can do further actions and customizations on the composite as a whole as well, such as changing styling and adding scripts.
* As a story designer, you can replace models or objects used by the composite in your story
