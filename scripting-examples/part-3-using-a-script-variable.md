# Part 3 Using a Script Variable

Currently we have set our Dropdown Box to Manual Input and filled it in the onInitialization script.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

There is an more elegant way to use a script variable in order to hold the information.

To do this we would need to create a variable first and adapt the Initialization script to be filling the variable instead of the Dropdown directly.
